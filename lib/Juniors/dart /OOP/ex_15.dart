// what is Constructor In Dart ?

//A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object. It is called automatically when an object is created, and it can be used to set the initial values for the objectâ€™s properties. For example, the following code creates a Person class object and sets the initial values for the name and age properties.

//Person person = Person("Mahmoud", 25);
