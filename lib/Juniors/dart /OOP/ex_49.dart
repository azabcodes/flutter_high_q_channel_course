//Types Of Inheritance In Dart
//Single Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, a class can inherit from only one class. In Dart, we can only extend one class at a time.
//
// Multilevel Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, a class can inherit from another class and that class can also inherit from another class. In Dart, we can extend a class from another class which is already extended from another class.
//
// Hierarchical Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, parent class is inherited by multiple subclasses. For example, the Car class can be inherited by the Toyota class and Honda class.
//
// Multiple Inheritance - In this type of inheritance, a class can inherit from multiple classes. Dart does not support multiple inheritance. For e.g. Class Toyota extends Car, Vehicle {} is not allowed in Dart.
